- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dartnix
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in videogame design, computer science, signal processing, automation/control, and maths in general.
- âœ… I have solid backgrounds on geometry, linear algebra and the complex field (which I love to bits).
- ðŸŸ¨ My favourite programming language is JS because it allows me to easily draw/graph/plot/animate. I also like Python and Java.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my Master of Science Thesis, about data pipelining and explainable AI in the manufatcuring industry.
- ðŸ”„ I have additional repositories for my school/uni projects over on my other account: [@JacopoCosta](https://github.com/JacopoCosta)
