- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Dartnix
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in videogame design, computer science, signal processing, automation/control, and maths in general.
- âœ… I have solid backgrounds on geometry, linear algebra and the complex field (which I love to bits).
- ðŸŸ¨ My favourite programming language is JS because it allows me to easily draw/graph/plot/animate. I also like Java and Python.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on my Master of Science Thesis, which combines Deep Learning, Anomaly Detection and Time Series.
- ðŸ”„ I have additional repositories for my school/uni projects over on my other account: <a href="github.com/JacopoCosta">github.com/JacopoCosta</a>
